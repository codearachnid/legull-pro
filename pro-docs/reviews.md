##Please Review Products
We value your opinions, and we believe that other users will as well.  Our customers can submit reviews for products listed for sale on our site.  Please share both positive and negative opinions, but we ask that you abide by these common sense guidelines.

##Helpful Reviews
Helpful reviews will have a detailed explanation of why you like or dislike something is better than general statements, but keep in mind that most site visitors will not read an overly long review.  Be honest and complete, including in your opinions about a product, and about any gifts or payment, including free product(s) that you received in exchange for writing your review.

##Relevance
Please keep reviews relevant.  Reviews should address the product being reviewed, and should remain relevant.  We reserve the right at all times to remove reviews that are irrelevant, inappropriate, or apparently motivated by something other than a desire to help other potential buyers make better buying decisions.  Other questions and comments can be directed to our customer support team.  You can contact us about reviews on the site, at the contact information provided in these terms.

##Right to Remove
We reserve the right to remove any review at any time, including in particular any reviews that are:

- obscene or in bad taste
- profane, or tending to bully or harass another person or people
- promoting illegal or immoral actions
- repeated comments
- promotional content
- competitors’ or sellers’ comments
- containing personally identifiable information of another person

##Safety Concerns
If you have safety concerns about a product, you can contact us directly with information about the product and about the problem you encountered.
